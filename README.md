Implemented and reported the findings on Subreddit Post Sentiment Classification on Reddit data by 

-> predicting the sentiment polarity of each post individually by using different classifiers ( Logistic Regression with One-hot vectorization, Logistic Regression with TF-IDF vectorization and SVC Classifier with One-hot vectorization).

-> Analyzed and discussed the effectiveness of the classifiers with justification for its appropriateness.

-> Reported classifiers’ behaviors with respect to Appropriate model “fit” (how well is the model fit to the training/test dataset),Dataset considerations (e.g. how are labels distributes, any other dataset issues?, and Classifier models (and their key parameters).

->  Tuned the parameters for both the vectorizer and classifier on the validation set using CV-fold validation on the train by selecting the best parameters sequentially. Reported the results with respect to the accuracy, macro-averaged precision, recall, and F1 on the test data.

-> implemented two new classifier features by adding other properties of the posts, leveraging embedding-based features and vectorization approaches.
